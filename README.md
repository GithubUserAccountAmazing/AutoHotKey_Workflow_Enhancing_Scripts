# AutoHotKey_Workflow_Enhancing_Scripts
Some basic scripts to make Windows nicer to work with (in my opinion :wink:).

This should give you some ideas of what is possible with AHK at a fairly basic level. 

<a href="https://github.com/originates/AutoHotKey_Workflow_Enhancing_Scripts/blob/main/chromeSwap.ahk">ChromeSwap.ahk</a> is probably the most 'advanced' script here.

Check out my script <a href="https://github.com/originates/HashCheck-and-Run">HashCheck-and-Run</a> for something slighly more advanced.
